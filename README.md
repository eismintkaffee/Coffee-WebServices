# Coffee-WebServices
These are the web services I made for our group in our Distributed Software Development Class.
Our group of three decided to make a coffee application that can list the menu, find the nearest coffee shop and order coffee.
I was resposible for making the following services: search coffee on menu, sort coffee on menu, make an order and view coffee history.
The web services were made in Visual Studio using CSharp.
